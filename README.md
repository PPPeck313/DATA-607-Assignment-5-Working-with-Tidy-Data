# DATA-607-Assignment-5-Working-with-Tidy-Data
The chart above describes August 2021 data for Israeli hospitalization (“Severe Cases”) rates for people under 50 (assume “50 and under”) and over 50, for both un-vaccinated and fully vaccinated populations. Analyze the data, and try to answer the questions posed in the spreadsheet. You’ll need some high level domain knowledge around:
1. Israel’s total population
2. Who is eligible to receive vaccinations
3. What does it mean to be fully vaccinated?\n
Please note any apparent discrepancies that you observe in your analysis.

1. Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a relational database!) that includes all the information above. You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.
2. Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data.
3. Perform analysis as described in the spreadsheet and above.
4. Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative
descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions. Please include in your homework submission:
  - The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository.
  - The URL for your rpubs.com web page.
